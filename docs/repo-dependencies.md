# Program Repository Map

This program consists of the following repositories:

1. **tracking-the-sun-program**
   - Program overview and documentation
   - Defines data contracts and conventions

2. **tracking-the-sun-system-size**
   - Analyzes what determines PV system size
   - Contextual, geographic, and temporal conditioning

3. **tracking-the-sun-inverter-architecture**
   - Studies inverter count, capacity per inverter,
     and configuration logic

4. **tracking-the-sun-scaling-regimes**
   - Identifies normative vs deviant configuration regimes
   - Time-aware but not predictive

5. **tracking-the-sun-risk-modeling**
   - Builds predictive models of deviation likelihood
   - Introduces statistical learning and validation

Each repository is intentionally scoped and defensible as a standalone analytical artifact.
