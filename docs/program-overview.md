# Program Overview — Tracking the Sun

This analytical program studies how solar systems are:
- sized
- configured
- scaled
- and sometimes oversized

across time, geography, and market context.

---

## Central Questions

1. What determines system size?
2. How are systems configured given size?
3. What constitutes expected vs abnormal scaling?
4. Where do deviations cluster?
5. Can deviation risk be predicted?

---

## Why Modular?

Each question requires:
- different conditioning variables
- different statistical framing
- different levels of abstraction

Modularity prevents analytical leakage.

---

## End State

The program culminates in:
- interpretable baselines
- deviation detection
- predictive risk surfaces

while remaining grounded in observed data.
