# Tracking the Sun — Program Overview

This program is a multi-repository analytical system built on the
Tracking the Sun dataset, focused on understanding photovoltaic
system design, scaling behavior, and configuration decisions over time.

Rather than answering a single question, the program is structured as
a sequence of analytical repositories that build on a shared analytical
substrate and progressively address more complex questions.

The program emphasizes:
- analytical rigor over surface-level EDA
- explicit assumptions and constraints
- reproducible, dependency-aware workflows
- separation of concerns across repositories

Each repository answers a well-scoped class of questions and produces
artifacts that may inform downstream analysis, without requiring
tight coupling or repeated re-cleaning of data.
